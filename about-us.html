       <li>Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment.</li>
       <li>The secret of health for both mind and body is not to mourn for the past, nor to worry about the future, but to live the present moment wisely and earnestly.</li>
       <li>In the end these things matter most: How well did you love? How fully did you live? How deeply did you let go?</li>
       <li>There are only two mistakes one can make along the road to truth; not going all the way, and not starting.</li>
    </ul>
